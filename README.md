Me, trying to learn the Node way.

To actually run the service, use the `run` script:
```
npm run-script run
```

To lint the service, use the `lint` script. This uses eslint, mostly extending the
Airbnb ruleset.

Configurations can be made in [config.js](config.js). Things like what port the app
runs on can be changed here.
